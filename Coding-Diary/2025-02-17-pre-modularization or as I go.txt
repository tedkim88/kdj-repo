When I watch skilled coders, I notice that they plan ahead, thinking about the functions they'll need.
They define those functions in advance before executing their code.

As a result, almost everything is modularized and well-organized,
making the execution process clean and simple.

Does this mean that good coders can effortlessly visualize all the functions they'll need in their heads?

I'm trying to mimic their approach, but I still find it more convenient to start with a step-by-step process, writing individual pieces of code first.
When I realize that a certain block of code needs to be modularized, I then turn it into a function.

In short, I still prefer modularizing as I go.
Sometimes, it's amazing to see how they modularize everything upfront, so all they have to do in the final stage is call those functions.
It looks really coolâ€”but I'll get there soon, too.
