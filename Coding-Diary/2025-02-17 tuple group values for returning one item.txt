Practicing modularization in C# using a simple calculator.

I received two user inputs, num1 and num2, and needed to return these two values to another method for calculation.

Since it's not possible to return two individual values from a method, I grouped them using a tuple.

I could also use a List<int> or an array to group the values, and then, when passing the grouped value to a method (such as the calculator), I could de-structure it to retrieve the individual values.

Since this is a simple and short app, I could declare variables and methods within a single class. However, I purposely chose to separate the classes to practice modularization and gain a better understanding of tuples, return values, and receiving parameters.
