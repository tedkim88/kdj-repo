 * STEPS FOR LOGGING IN A USER:

 * 1. The user will provide credentials with a form.
 * 2. Our script will search for the username in the database.
 * 3. If the username is found, our script will compare the submitted password with the stored hash in the database.
 * 4. If the verification is successful, the script will then set a value in the $_SESSION to the user ID and redirects to a post-login page (in our case, admin.php).
