Hello. This is a repo for uploading my portfolio(in the making).
1. Project title: WordSmith ia a javascript-based webapp for learning vocab and manage my own word lists using firebase-db.
   there is a quiz function, so you can search for the word, its meaning, if you want to memorize the word, you can click add to the list, and save(to db).
   after saving the list, you can click quiz and review the words.
** This project is not a finished version yet
   --I used a free word API, so sometimes it doesn't offer info on certain words.
   --There is a board function(at first I imagined using it for Q&A about word usage,though), but I made it only for learning purpose.
   --I'm using Set object to prevent some duplicate data in the quiz function, but my db does have duplicate data due to the way of saving lists.
   --When loading and rendering, I'm using Set to make a neat list of words for quiz. This was a first trial project, so I guess I can improve it later or for next project

2. Project title : OLTP-shopping / Rental Management System.
   These are C# & Blazor based projects. Unlike the first project, wordsmith, I was given rough guidelines for these projects in C# classes at NAIT.
   But they were just rough guidelines, such as the purpose of the website and or the webapp.
   So basically these apps reflect my knowledge on Entity Framework Core and SQL queries to extract certain data I want, and rendering using Blazor.
   These two apps are based on SSMS database file on my local computer, but I'm not sure if I'm allowed to upload the bacpac files, so
   for showing my coding and knowledge, I chose to upload these two apps except the db files.
   so they won't be executed without DB, but please consider the BLL service folders, front end, and how I use view models.
   Instead, I'll record my screen using this app and am thinking about uploading a video of how it works.

3.WeatherInfo-simple this is not a 'project'. This was my first attempt(practice) to use free API to make a webapp that has a certain purpose(weather history).
