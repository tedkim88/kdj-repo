# KDJ Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Below are the details of the projects I am working on.

## 1. **WordSmith** (JavaScript-based Web App)
**Description**:  
WordSmith is a JavaScript-based web application designed to help users learn vocabulary and manage their own word lists using Firebase Database. The app includes a quiz feature, allowing users to search for words, view their meanings, add words to a personal list, and then quiz themselves on the saved words.
To prevent some possible errors, I just uploaded some files that might be a little unnecessary, sorry about that.

**Usage: This app is using parcel so, you can download the wordsmith folder and in the terminal if you type, 'npm run dev' it will be executed.
you can click create account, log in, and word screen will pop up.**

**Features**:
- **Search Functionality**: Search for words and view their meanings.
- **Add to Word List**: Add words to a custom list stored in Firebase.
- **Quiz**: Review words through quizzes based on your saved lists.

**Challenges**:
- **Didn't spend time for design: it was just for understanding and applying functionality**
- **API Limitations**: The free word API may not provide information for certain words.
- **Board Functionality**: Initially planned for Q&A about word usage, but it's currently used just for learning.
- **Duplicate Data**: I used a Set object to avoid duplicates in the quiz, which was successful, but the DB may still contain duplicates due to how the lists are saved. It could be improved later by manipulating data BEFORE saving.
- **First Trial** -- With the benefit of hindsight, I could've done things in a much simpler way, by planning ahead about the functionality I was going to use, and data structures I was going to use. When I first started this project, I only thought about the purpose of the web app--to help learn English words.
  
  **TakeAway** : I'm going to plan ahead about the functionality and data structure so that the codes can be as simple but efficient as possible.

**Status**:  
This project is still in progress, and I plan to improve it in the future.

## 2. **OLTP Shopping / Rental Management System** (C# & Blazor & SSMS(SQL Queries))
**Description**: 
**Note** I was responsible for **'SalesSystem'**, Sales refund related page for this team project. Each one had their own part.
**POSystem is not my part.**

These projects demonstrate my understanding of C# and Blazor. They are based on rough guidelines provided in my C# classes at NAIT. The applications are designed around Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) and rental management systems. These apps utilize Entity Framework Core for data management, SQL queries to extract data, and Blazor for rendering the front end.

**Features**:
- **Entity Framework Core**: Data handling and database management.
- **Blazor**: Front-end rendering and UI interactions.
- **SQL Queries**: Extracting and presenting data from a local SSMS database.

**Note**:
- The database files (bacpac) are not included in this repository. However, the applications' functionality can be reviewed based on the BLL service folders, front end, and view models.
- I plan to upload a video showcasing how the application works.

## 3. **WeatherInfo Simple Web App**  
**Description**:  
This is not a full-fledged project but rather my first attempt at using a free API to create a simple web application for tracking weather history.

---

**Note**:  
These projects are works in progress or practice attempts. The code structure, use of services, and data management techniques can be evaluated without the database files. I'll be uploading videos for some projects to demonstrate their functionality.
